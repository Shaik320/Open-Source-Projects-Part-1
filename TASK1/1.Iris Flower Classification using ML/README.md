# LGMVIP TASK 1: Iris Flowers Classification ML
PROBLEM STATEMENT
This data set consists of the physical parameters of three species of flower — Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica. The numeric parameters which the dataset contains are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width and Petal length. In this data we will be predicting the classes of the flowers based on these parameters.The data consists of continuous numeric values which describe the dimensions of the respective features. We will be training the model based on these features.

ABOUT IRIS DATASET
The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.![irisv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83866738/132368715-1a5d41b1-3137-4f92-b804-25a25d1b214f.png)Attribute Information:

Therefore,This dataset is best predicted using a random forest or a decision tree classifier. This is so because two species have many similar features and differ by some minute difference in a combination of features,which cannot be separated by any form of regression. Hence, it can be classified better by a non-linear classifier like a decision tree or an array of decision trees (known as random forest). We have just implemented some of the common Machine Learning. Since the dataset is small with very few features.
